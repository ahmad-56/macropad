<h1>AHMAD HASSAN'S MACROPAD</h1>
<h2>Process of making</h2>
<p>I used KiCad for designing the PCB which involved some steps, firstly I had to design the schematic and the pcb and then finally route the pcb. As for the Case I used Fusion360. It was quite a smooth built however I did run into several issues like for example finding the correct symbol and footprint for the **SK6812MINI-E** and fixing the dimensions in the 3d model. Both of which however now are fixed and fine :).</p>
